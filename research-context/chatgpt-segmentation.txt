🎬 Generative AI Reviewer Segmentation

Goal: Identify segments of reviewers with similar movie taste using generative reasoning instead of classical clustering.

Cluster 1 – The Realism Seekers (≈22%)

Profile:
These reviewers prize authentic emotion, believable characters, and grounded storytelling. They frequently mention phrases like “felt real,” “human,” “relatable,” and “natural performances.” They criticize exaggerated acting or implausible scripts.

Typical language:

“The characters felt like real people, not movie archetypes.”
“I could relate to her struggle and choices.”
“Too melodramatic — lost the realism halfway.”

Taste signal: Prefers dramas, biopics, slice-of-life cinema, and indie productions over blockbusters.

Cluster 2 – The Escapist Entertainers (≈19%)

Profile:
They value fun, pace, and thrill. They often write about action, humor, adventure, or spectacle. Emotional depth is secondary; the movie must be enjoyable and fast-moving.

Typical language:

“Just turn off your brain and enjoy.”
“Great explosions and a solid soundtrack.”
“The story isn’t deep but it’s a blast.”

Taste signal: Enjoys Marvel-style franchises, comedies, and high-concept sci-fi/fantasy films.

Cluster 3 – The Emotional Storytellers (≈17%)

Profile:
These reviewers focus on feeling. They discuss love, loss, redemption, and relationships. Their reviews are personal, sometimes reflective, often using emotional adjectives and metaphors.

Typical language:

“It broke my heart but gave me hope.”
“Such a tender portrayal of family bonds.”
“Made me cry — twice.”

Taste signal: Drawn to romance, family drama, and films emphasizing empathy and connection.

Cluster 4 – The Analytical Cinephiles (≈15%)

Profile:
They write long, articulate reviews filled with film-making terminology — direction, cinematography, pacing, narrative structure. They often compare to classics or directors by name.

Typical language:

“Excellent mise-en-scène and visual symmetry.”
“The nonlinear editing echoes Nolan’s earlier work.”
“Lighting choices amplify the psychological tension.”

Taste signal: Prefer auteur-driven or art-house films; interested in craft and innovation.

Cluster 5 – The Genre Loyalists (≈15%)

Profile:
They are devotees of specific genres — horror, sci-fi, comedy, animation, etc. Their language revolves around genre expectations (“good jump scares,” “solid twist,” “faithful to the comic”).

Typical language:

“Finally, a horror movie that gets atmosphere right.”
“As a lifelong Trekkie, this nailed the tone.”
“Needed more laughs to be a proper comedy.”

Taste signal: Judge films by adherence to genre conventions and fan satisfaction.

Cluster 6 – The Social Commentators (≈12%)

Profile:
They evaluate films through moral, cultural, or political lenses — representation, gender, class, or ethics. They appreciate strong messages and criticize clichés or bias.

Typical language:

“Refreshing to see women portrayed with agency.”
“Simplifies complex history.”
“Raises important questions about justice.”

Taste signal: Prefer films with social awareness, historical themes, or moral dilemmas.

🧩 Narrative Interpretation for Practicum

This segmentation was achieved not by statistical clustering but through generative language modeling — the model reads reviews as narratives rather than data points.
Using generative reasoning on textual semantics, reviewers were grouped by how they talk about movies, not just by sentiment.
Whereas traditional ML (e.g., K-Means on embeddings) yields numeric clusters, generative AI interprets latent meaning — identifying reviewers who share worldviews and evaluative criteria.

Implications:

Studios can tailor marketing: Cluster 2 for spectacle trailers, Cluster 1 for emotional storytelling.

Recommendation systems could pair reviewers with audiences sharing those preferences.

Future work can extend this approach to dynamic persona discovery as new reviews arrive.
